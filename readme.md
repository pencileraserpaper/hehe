# 🧪 Just a Test (Taylor's Version)

Welcome to my test repo — a quiet place in the middle of the internet where I’m figuring out Git and GitHub one step at a time.  
This might not be a masterpiece (yet), but it’s got potential... kind of like a track 5.

## 🎯 What’s Going On?

This repo is mostly just me messing around — initializing, committing, pushing.  
You could say it’s me being in my “experimenting with version control” era.

## 💻 What’s Inside?

- A README that may or may not be wearing red 
- Some files that are probably never getting back together
- No time-traveling yet, but maybe someday ✨

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/test-repo.git
cd test-repo
